Rum deer project: match dummies in sequoia output to real non-genotyped individuals

Various functions to automate matching dummy IDs to IDs of non-genotyped individuals, based on field-observed mother-offspring relations and rut data. Also matches IDs of mystery dead individuals / mystery calves to possible 'proper' IDs. 

Disclaimers:
- Random errors when input data is not exactly as expected
- Not properly documented (yet?)
- Highly specific to the Rum red deer data.
