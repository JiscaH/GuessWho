Description: This R package compares a genetic pedigree to field-observed 
    candidate parents. It replaces dummy IDs and IDs of 'mystery samples' by 
    field-IDs of non-genotyped individuals where possible, and flags cases 
    where the most-likely 'field parent' differs from the pedigree parent.
